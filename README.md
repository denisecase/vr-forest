# vr-forest

A simple, immersive boreal forest experience built with A-Frame and deployed via GitHub Pages.
Designed to be simple, accessible, and cross-platform — viewable on desktop, mobile, or VR headsets.

Skills needed: 

- Just a bit of [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) experience to build a web page. 
- A GitHub account.
- Know how to publish your GitHub repo using GitHub pages. 

The free [A-Frame](https://aframe.io) framework provides everything else, except the assets - the sounds, images, and models you want to include.

## Scene Highlights

- 360° equirectangular boreal forest skybox
- Forest floor texture with natural moss and earth
- Ambient loon call audio on repeat
- Slightly animated bear cub modeled in `.glb` format
- Floating welcome message that fades slowly
- Minimal user interface
